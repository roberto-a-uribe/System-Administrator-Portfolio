# System-Administrator-Portfolio



This repository documents my hands-on lab projects simulating a real-world Windows enterprise environment, with a focus on systems administration from domain setup, configuration, security and monitoring. All work is performed in an home based virtual lab using VMWare Workstation 17 Pro, using Windows Server Standard Eval edition 2025 and Windows 11 Pro client to build out core infrastructure services like Active Directory, DNS, Group Policy, adding clients to domain and PowerShell troubleshooting which are integrated throughout.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical skills that reflect the day-to-day responsibilities of a systems administrator.

## <b>Projects </b>


### Project 1 – Active Directory Domain Setup
Deployed a Windows Server 2025 VM in home lab using VMWare Workstation 17 PRO and promoted it to a domain controller in a new forest (`BERTO.LOCAL`). Configured DNS.
Add PC to domain (berto.local)
Verify DNS settings


### Project 2 – User, Group, and OU Management
Created a structured set of Organizational Units (OUs) to simulate a departmental hierarchy. Provisioned user accounts for IT, HR, Marketing and Sales; created corresponding security groups; and assigned users to the correct groups. Verified configuration using PowerShell and documented the process with screenshots.



### Project 3 – Group Policy Implementation (Future)
Planned demonstration how to enforce workstation policies across different departments using Group Policy Objects (GPOs), including security hardening for domain PCs and users.
