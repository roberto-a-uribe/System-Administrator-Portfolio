# System-Administrator-Portfolio
This repository documents my hands-on lab projects simulating a real-world Windows enterprise environment, with a focus on systems administration. All work is performed in an home based virtual lab using VMWare Workstation 17 Pro, using Windows Server Standard Eval edition 2025 and Windows 11 Pro to build out core infrastructure services like Active Directory, DNS, Group Policy, add clients to domain and PowerShell troubleshooting which are integrated throughout.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate practical skills that reflect the day-to-day responsibilities of a systems administrator.
